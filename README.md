# Hello there!
Have a look at my works on the Möbius Modeller. This is my introduction to generative modelling, something that I am very much curious about. Ever wondered how designs can be made analytical to create a launch-pad for designers to rocket improvements on.

## Rotating Floor

In this script, a _building_ with rotating and resizing floors is generated. The floor sizes are controlled with a sine curve, and the rotation is linearly mapped to the floor number. Here is the [working demo](https://mobius-08.design-automation.net/dashboard?file=https:%2F%2Fmobius.ramdon.team%2Fw1_s3_u3_demo_law_curves_exp.mob&defaultViewer=cad){:target="_blank"}.

## Undulating Wall
This scrip generates, yes, a _wall_. The wall follows a sine curve along an arc of right angle. The wall also has direction-selective thickness. You can see the [working demo](https://mobius-08.design-automation.net/dashboard?file=https:%2F%2Fmobius.ramdon.team%2FWeek1_Coding_Assignment.mob&defaultViewer=cad){:target="_blank"} here. 

More details:

- It generates an arc polyline.
- It offsets the positions along the arc outwards using a cosine Law Curve.
- It extrudes the deformed arc to form a set of vertical panels.

## Arched Roofs of The Winter Gardens
Catenary arched roofs ftw! This script generates arched roofs that follow catenary curves. The structure is loosely based on The Winter Gardens pavilion in Sheffield. There you go - [working demo](https://mobius-08.design-automation.net/dashboard?file=https:%2F%2Fmobius.ramdon.team%2FArched_Roof_of_The_Winter_Gardens.mob&defaultViewer=cad){:target="_blank"}.
